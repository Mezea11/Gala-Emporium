Welcome to the Gala Emporium website. 

This is a fullstack application that runs on several front and backend technologies.
The project is meant to be more backend oriented and follows best practices with DDD, OOP and Git version control.

This webpage uses a MongoDB Atlas Cluster that stores our entire collection of datasets and is built with
Node.js, Express/Mongoose and a few other dependencies. 

The fictional Gala Emporium website is a fully fleshed out webpage that is meant to be for a scene rental company
where arrangers can login to their own "clubs" and post/remove events. It also features a loginsystem meant for users
so that they can purchase tickets for the events listed on the website.

The project is an excercise given to us students at Teknikh√∂gskolan Lund as a way to deepen our knowledge in database
technologies and start working with several JavaScript backend-frameworks.

This project is a WIP and more features will be added in the near future!
